## 🏃‍♀️ Get Some Exercise 🏃

Run `go run exercise_generator.go` to get started.

This script will create a `./do_some_exercises` folder with the file `exercises.filesuffixyouchoose` and `exercises_test.filesuffixyouchoose`.

To test your code, navigate into the `./do_some_exercises` folder and use the makefile to run your tests

* Go: `make go`
* Python: `make python`
* C: `make c` ~ no exercises yet
* Elixir: `make elixir` ~ no exercises yet
* OCAML: `make ocaml`

Fill in the exercises in `./do_some_exercises/exercises` until all your tests pass.

I wrote this on a Mac. To get all the required dependencies, use homebrew

* `brew install go`
* `brew install python`
* `brew install cunit` - C unit testing framework
* `brew install elixir`
* `brew install ocaml`
