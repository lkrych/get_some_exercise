## 🏃‍♀️ Exercise Generator 🏃

Run `go run exercise_generator.go` to get started.

This script will create a `./do_some_exercises` folder with the file `exercises.filesuffixyouchoose` and `exercises_test.filesuffixyouchoose`.

To test your code, navigate into the `./do_some_exercises` folder and use the makefile to run your tests

* Go: `make go`
* Python: `make python`
* C: `make c`
* Elixir: `make elixir`

Fill in the exercises in `./do_some_exercises/exercises` until all your tests pass.

I wrote this on a Mac. To get all the required dependencies, use homebrew

`brew install go`
`brew install python`
`brew install cunit` - C unit testing framework
`brew install elixir`
